	<h1>Spyder IDE</h1>
<p>Finally I decided to give Spyder IDE5 a go. I installed it in a virtual environment as recomended in the official documentation. 

	My pc runs on PopOS 22 (debian/ubuntu)
	
	I installed the IDE using the pip. First create and activate a  virtual environment in which to install Spyder.
</p>	


<article>
	<p>python3 -m venv spyder-env
		source spyder-env/bin/activate</p>
</article>
	

<p>After activating your environment, to install Spyder:</p>
<article>
	<p>pip install spyder</p>
</article>
	


	


<p>I was confused how to use the already existing python and other packages(outside ethe venv) in the new virtual environment. 
</p>
<p>Activate the environment using: source spyder-env/bin/activate

	Start a Python interpreter there by running the command python.</p>
<p>Run this: 
	<article>
		<p>import sys; sys.executable</p>
	</article>

	
	 This will give a path:
	 <article>
		<p>'/home/alex/spyder-env/bin/python'</p>
	</article>
	 
	 
</p>
<p>Start Spyder and run the same command import sys; sys.executable in a Console.
</p>
<p>If the resulting paths are the same, then Spyder and the package are in the same environment. 

	Otherwise, Install just the spyder-kernels(can be installed using pip) package into the myenv environment, 
	and set your Python interpreter path in Spyder's Preferences to point to myenv's Python executable.</p>
