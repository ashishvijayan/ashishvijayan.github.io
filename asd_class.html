<h1>ASD classification</h1>

<hr />

<p>
    Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) represent a formidable challenge for psychiatry 
    and neuroscience because of their high prevalence, life-long nature, complexity 
    and heterogeneity. Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)(DiMartino, 2014), 
    a grassroots consortium aggregating and openly sharing existing resting-state 
    functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) datasets with
    corresponding structural MRI and phenotypic information from 487 individuals
    with ASD and 557 age-matched typical controls. ABIDE II has 1004 samples
    and each sample has 1446 features.
    Here in this <a href="https://github.com/ashishvijayan/Autism-spectrum-disorder-ASD-classification-using-ABIDE2-dataset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>,
     I use different machine learning models to correctly classify ASD from controls.
